<h1>Hi, I'm Tarosh! <br/>
<a href="https://github.com/Tarosh-Kuchroo">ECE Hardware Designer</a>, 
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarosh-kuchroo/">Quantum & Photonics Researcher</a></h1>

Master’s student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at UMass Amherst with hands-on experience in **quantum hardware, photonics, RF systems, and PCB design**. I build tools that bridge physics, electronics, and engineering — from **RF resonant coils** to **lab CAD fixtures** and **full PCB systems**.
